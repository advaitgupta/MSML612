Curriculum-Aware Predictor Fix

This shows how to modify the predictor to maintain consistent real-time horizons
during curriculum training with different step frequencies.

    Calculate prediction horizon in steps to maintain consistent real-time prediction.
    
    Args:
        target_real_time_seconds: Desired prediction time (e.g., 2.0 seconds)
        step_duration: Current curriculum step duration (1/frequency)
    
    Returns:
        Number of steps to predict to achieve target real-time horizon

    return max(1, int(target_real_time_seconds / step_duration))

# Example usage during curriculum training:
# 10Hz: step_duration=0.1s → H = 2.0/0.1 = 20 steps (2 seconds)
# 20Hz: step_duration=0.05s → H = 2.0/0.05 = 40 steps (2 seconds)  
# 50Hz: step_duration=0.02s → H = 2.0/0.02 = 100 steps (2 seconds)
# 100Hz: step_duration=0.01s → H = 2.0/0.01 = 200 steps (2 seconds)

# Implementation approach:
# 1. Modify LSTMPredictorCallback to accept target_real_time instead of fixed H
# 2. Extract current step_duration from curriculum wrapper
# 3. Dynamically calculate H based on current frequency
# 4. Recreate predictor head when H changes (or use max H with masking)
